History
-------

Classic ruleset has a long history. It started deep in the past before Civilization II ever came out.
After Civ2, Classic became a synthesis of three things. Civilization I, which it was built from, 
new features in Civilization II that were better, a very few things from other Civ sources which were
considered good, and a touch of salt and spice modifications to make it all work right together!
The result is an experience of Classic Civilization that is somehow more "classic" than any of the 
original games--in some people's view at least! 

Nevertheless, time has moved on, and you are highly encouraged to try some other more modern rulesets
for variations, such as:

Civ2Civ3 - A beginner level mix of Civ2 and Civ3 with a liberal amount of other changes.

Multiplayer+ - In many ways an even more Classic and much more refined version of classic Civilization, 
 ... with many balance changes that it functions well even with massive multiplayer human conditions.

Multiplayer-Evolution (MP2) - The ultimate synthesis of Classic Civilization with modern features and 
 ... advancements. All the best classical mechanics are kept, and only the best newer features and 
 ... units are added. This preserves the hard-edged chess match of older Civ with the finer balance 
 ... and portfolio of features, new units, and improvements, of years of evolution and playtesting.
