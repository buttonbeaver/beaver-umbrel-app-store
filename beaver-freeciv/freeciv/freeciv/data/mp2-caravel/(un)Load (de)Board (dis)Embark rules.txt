Load/Unload Board/Deboard Rules 
============================================================================
THESE ARE GOALS TO IMPLEMENT FOR THE MIGRATION FROM CLIENT HARD-CODING TO 
USING THE RULESET FOR TRANSPORT LOGISTICS CONTROL.

Transport swapping
============================================================================
Transport swapping at sea between Ship types (maybe create a "Ship" flag)
OR between RiverShip class on a river:
  uses all moves; EXCEPT:
    LandAirSea, uses 1 5/9 moves
  can't be done if cargo has no moves left

Transport swapping on SHIP units in a Quay, Naval Base, City
  Legal, uses no moves

Transport swapping on other transporters:
  Legal in all cases where Unload is legal (assumes Load is also legal)

Disembarking and Embarking
=============================================================================
Disembarking LandAirSea to adjacent transport on blank sea tile should cost 1 5/9 moves, not 1 move.

"Unload" can be thought of as "Disembark to same tile" and can get a twin actionenabler
  in all cases where Disembark adjacent is allowed, with same move_cost.


Wagon type:
  Allowed for all at full cost to all units (except LandAirSea)
    This means an making an "Unload" enabler for emulating "Disembark to same tile"
    LandAirSea costs 1 move for each.

Truck type:
  Disallowed except for Foot Soldiers, costs full moves. 
    This means an making an "Unload" enabler for emulating "Disembark to same tile"
    LandAirSea costs 1 move for each.

LandRail class:
  Disallowed except for Foot Soldiers, costs full moves. 
    This means an making an "Unload" enabler for emulating "Disembark to same tile"
    LandAirSea costs 1 move for each.

Helicopter class:
  Allowed only for "Foot" and Artillery types, at full cost (emulating disembark to same tile)


Boarding/Loading
=============================================================================
note: if it's legal cargo server already allows it. If not, it doesn't.
Forbid only cases the ruleset wants to "outlaw":

Wagons
   Unit Types with less than 3 moves can do the Board command AND Cargo-class, all else cannot:
    If we can't check base move score, we can make a UnitFlag, otherwise we need a separate 
    UnitClass and change cargo characteristics.

Trucks
   Unit Types with less than 3 moves can do the Board command, AND Bomb, AND Cargo-class, but:
   Boarding on a blank tile (no base or city) is illegal except for "Foot" soldiers

Trains (LandRail class)
   Unit Types with less than 3 moves can do the Board command AND Bomb, AND Cargo-class AND Zeppelin
   Boarding on a blank tile (no base or city) is illegal except for "Foot soldiers" and Zeppelins

Sea class:
  Allowed in all cases where Sea units are allowed to go: City, Quay, Naval Base, Blank Sea tile (e.g., Fighter on Carrier)

RiverShip class:
  Allowed in all cases: City, Quay, Naval Base, Blank River tile.

Helicopter class:
  Loading allowed for all legal cargo, anywhere. (rescue pick-up!)


===============================================================================
Deboard/Unloading:

Wagons and Trucks (LandRoad class)
  Allowed at no cost in ALL bases and cities for all cargo types.
  was Disallowed on blank tile to all except LandAirSea (change cost from 0 to 1 move)
    now allowed to all, at full cost (emulates disembark to adjacent)

Trains (LandRail)
  Allowed at no cost in cities for all units.
  Allowed at no cost in a base or quay.
  was Disallowed on blank tile to all except LandAirSea (change cost from 0 to 1move)
    now allowed to Foot Soldiers at full cost (emulates disembark to adjacent)

Sea Class:
  Allowed in all cases at no cost, where Sea units are allowed to go: City, Naval Base.

Rivership:
  Unloading in City/Quay/Naval Base always legal, at no cost.
  Unloading in other bases and blank tiles was disallowed.
  was Disallowed on blank tile to all except LandAirSea (change cost from 0 to 1 move)
    now allowed to Foot Soldiers at full cost (emulates disembark to adjacent)

Helicopter class:
  Allowed in city, naval base, or airbase, for all legal cargo, at no cost.
  Allowed to blank tile for "Foot" and Artillery types, at full cost (emulating disembark to same tile)
    LandAirSea (cost 1 move)

==================================================================================
What will change/simplify in unit helptext, documentation, and logistics charts:

Transport swapping rules simplified/changed for all and LandAirSea.
Disembarking rules for Marines swapping at sea.
UnitType "Goods" is not limited to load on commerce units only.
Logistic charts will change "Step of" to "Disembark" and show unload as "all moves" instead of "all"
LandAirSea unloading emulates disembarking to same tile at 1 move cost.
